# Subtle Memory Management Issues in Objective-C using ARC

This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, error in Objective-C related to memory management when using Automatic Reference Counting (ARC) alongside manual memory management techniques.  The primary issue revolves around the interaction between ARC and the `retain`, `release`, and `autorelease` methods, particularly within the `dealloc` method.

The `bug.m` file showcases the problematic code, while `bugSolution.m` presents the corrected version.  Understanding this issue is crucial for writing robust and stable Objective-C applications.
