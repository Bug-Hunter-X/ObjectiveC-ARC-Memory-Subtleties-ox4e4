In Objective-C, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with memory management, specifically with the interaction between ARC (Automatic Reference Counting) and manual memory management using `retain`, `release`, and `autorelease`.  For example, consider this scenario:

```objectivec
@interface MyClass : NSObject
@property (nonatomic, retain) NSString *myString;
@end

@implementation MyClass
- (void)dealloc {
    [myString release];
    [super dealloc];
}
@end

MyClass *obj = [[MyClass alloc] init];
obj.myString = [[NSString alloc] initWithString: @"Hello"];
// ... some code ...
[obj release];
```

In this code, if `myString` isn't properly handled with `release`, it could lead to a memory leak.  While ARC handles many memory management details, manually releasing objects in `dealloc` methods requires precision.  If `myString` is `nil` when `dealloc` is called, the `[myString release]` will crash.

Another tricky error could occur in custom `retain` and `release` methods within the `MyClass` without properly incrementing and decrementing the retain count in a thread safe way, leading to unexpected behavior like double-releasing or not releasing at all.
